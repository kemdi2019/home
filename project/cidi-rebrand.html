                    Wealthbar’s integration into CI included the integration of CI Direct Investment (prev. wealthbar)
                    with CI Direct Trading (prev. virtual brokers). Creating a dashboard that showcased this integration
                    was a highly important stakeholder request. As a designer on the project, I was in several
                    stakeholder meetings where we discussed what we were going for and the aim of the overall
                    experience.

                <h2>My branding questionnaire</h2>
                <p>
                    What are the top level brand goals for CI Direct and/or the Trading and Investing sub-brands?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Typically brands will have a short list of descriptors for how they want the brand to be
                        perceived – for example Trustworthy, Effective, Friendly, and Aspirational – with some copy
                        about the most important target demographics, and how the brand is differentiating from
                        competitors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the brand one-pager we received a couple months back, it talks about wanting marketing
                        photos to be thought-provoking, inspiring and sophisticated. Are those important brand goals for
                        the CI Direct brands generally? Are there any brand goals that are more important than those?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It would be helpful for us to understand how CI Direct brand and each sub-brand plans to
                    differentiate from the banks’ trading apps and other competitors like WealthSimple. Here is our
                    current sense of the previous high-level brand and product direction for the two apps. In what ways
                    should these descriptions change or be refined based on the vision going forward?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For CI Direct Investing: To make investing feel approachable and welcoming. Priorities have
                        included ease of use, adding comfort by making advisors accessible, and facilitating
                        “effortless” savings that are long term oriented.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For CI Direct Trading: Historically, the offering has focused on offering effective, lower-cost
                        trading services to active traders. As we understand it, the focus is shifting towards retail
                        traders, who are more sensitive to usability and intuitiveness, so we’ve been expecting these to
                        be key product experience priorities going forward.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    How do we want customers to see our offerings as being superior to the established banks’ investing
                    products?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do we want customers to see our offerings as being superior to products like WealthSimple?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some more concrete brand adjectives - how important are these to the CI Direct brand
                    experience? (1-5 rating)
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplicity</li>
                    <li>Distinctiveness (that is, stands out from other brands) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Other than CID Investing focusing its colour scheme on the Cobalt brand colour and CID Trading
                    focusing its scheme on the Sapphire colour, what other brand and product strategy differences are
                    there between the two products?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’ve historically thought of CI Direct’s most important target customers as professional
                    Canadians roughly in the 30-55 year old age bracket. Is this the most important demographic when
                    we’re considering how the design will be received?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are there any visual references from apps or design systems that you’ve used or seen that you
                    think are particularly good examples of some of the key brand goals?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are there any other brand or competitive positioning goals you could share?
                </p>



                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step included updating the client onboarding process. This consisted of updating the user
                    journey, color palette and icons
                </p>
