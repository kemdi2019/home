                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, I can’t share too much about this project since it’s an internal tool. I was
                    tasked with bringing an internal app to the modern age. It had been several years since the last
                    update. As you can probably tell, it was an exhaustive project with hand-in-hand collaboration
                    with the dev and QA teams. I was the lead UI/UX designer on the project.
                </p>

                <h2>Role</h2>
                <p>
                    Design <br>
                    Research <br>
                    Illustration
                </p>

                <div class="colours">

                    <span>#916D5D</span>

                </div>

                <h2>Design Notes</h2>
                <p>
                    Every page currently has a Save, Back, and Next button<br>
                    - Implement a “clear” button for the IP questionnaire. Users would expect a reset button to clear
                    the answers on the form<br>
                    - Can’t have two reset buttons that do different things - would cause confusion on the part of the
                    user<br>
                    Mosaic: ESG or Non-ESG portfolio suggestions
                </p>

                <p><u>Investment Options</u></p>
                <p>
                    After selecting “Guided Portfolio" or “Individual Investments", user has no way of knowing that the
                    next step is INVESTMENT SELECTION. There is a Next’ button that can’t be used until the user has
                    gone through the investment selection process.
                </p>

                <p><u>Suggestions</u></p>
                <p>
                    - rename Next button to Investment Selection<br>
                    - highlight INVESTMENT SELECTION when next button is clicked
                </p>

                <p><u>MOSAIC/PS/PSS Selection</u></p>
                <p>
                    - Images or no images?<br>
                    - make selection obvious including on mobile<br>
                    - when a selection is made, reduce the opacity of non-selected options<br>
                    - include highlighted border on the selected option
                </p>
                <div class="images flex">
                    <div class="card">
                        <img src="img/prestige-1.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <img src="img/prestige-selection.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <img src="img/prestige-selection-made.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><u>Questionnaire</u></p>
                <p>
                    - Currently, the Back button would theoretically take the user one page back - the ps/pss mosaic
                    selection page. No need for the Reset button to do the same task since that would be redundant.<br>
                    - Rename the Reset button, should have the same current functionality - clearing radio checkboxes
                    Regarding ESG or Non-ESG for the Mosaic selection:<br>
                    - when SKIP QUESTIONNAIRE is selected, highlight a “ESG or Non-ESG" choice
                </p>
                <div class="images flex">
                    <div class="card">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><u>Selected/Suggested Portfolio</u></p>
                <p>
                    - The only page with a Reset button<br>
                    - Reset button clears the choices and takes the user back to the ps/pss/mosaic selection<br>
                    - Hovering on the Reset button should tell the user what the button does
                </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the exhaustive nature of the project, I decided to have the dev environment on my local. This
                    meant that I could implement and experience the changes I wanted in real-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the major requests from stakeholders was a new selection screen to accomodate the new
                    experience they were hoping to implement. Wireframes and userflows are a very important part of the
                    user experience design process. I went through a few itirations of this particular screen before
                    landing on something that I felt worked well on desktop and could easily translate to mobile
                    screens.
