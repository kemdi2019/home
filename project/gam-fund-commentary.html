                    Modernizing the fund commentary page for GAM. In addition to redesigning the page and making it
                    appear more modern, I also designed the accompanying AEM component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to utilize a tile format rather than the aged list version that was currently on the site.
                    This would make it easier to navigate and give it a more modern spin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filters like “quarter” and “year” were also removed based on lack of use from the users and to
                    reduce redundancy — the list is now compressed and no longer expanded — therefore, certain filters
                    were no longer necessary. This meant a cleaner look and easier style o navigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Fund commentary” has also been removed from the commentary title since that’s also redundant, i.e.
                    CI Canadian REIT ETF – Fund Commentary – June 2024
                </p>

                <div class="colours">
                    <span>#3E71AA</span>
                    <span>#203469</span>
                    <span>#000</span>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Having a default 4x4 display seemed like the best way to go considering the sum total of
                    commentaries that are usually housed on the page. It meant less scrolling while also not
                    overwhelming the user with too much information.
                </p>

                <h2>Designing the AEM component</h2>

                <p>
                    In addition to the page design, I also tackled the AEM component. While the page design accounted
                    for the end user, the AEM component accounted for the content designers. The middle men who would
                    input the data onto the page as intended. For this component I worked closely with the dev team and
                    QA’d the component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The component made the update process a lot more seamless and significantly cut down the time needed
                    to update the page.
                </p>

                <p><u>New component design</u></p>

                <p><u>UI/UX notes:</u></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Path to commentary links to the PDF</li>
                    <li>The fund title is displayed on the tile, i.e. if the fund title is “CI Enhanced Government Bond
                        ETF
                        – June
                        2024” and Marret Asset Management is selected under “Team” then this is how the tile will be
                        displayed:</li>

                    <li>Team should have the 6 different options</li>
                    <li>Accent colour refers to the colour of the download icon and the colour of the team name. The
                        default
                        should be #3e71aa which is being used on the current fund commentary page. There should be three
                        other
                        choices: sapphire, black, white.</li>

                    <li>The colour choices for tile background colour should be the same as the background colours on
                        the
                        container component: none, black, white, sapphire, slate, gold, link, graphite, platinum, grey,
                        burgundy,
                        cobalt. “white” should be the default colour.</li>

                    <li>Tile outline refers to the drop shadow. There should be two options: drop shadow and none. “Drop
                        shadow”
                        should be the default.</li>
                    <li>The default fund title style should be the same paragraph styling that’s currently being used on
                        the
                        fund
                        commentary page. The other font styles should be available as a choice, i.e. Headline 1 – Dark,
                        Headline 1 –
                        Light, Headline 2 – Dark, Headline 2 – Light, etc.</li>
                </ul>
